#Face Detection Project

This repository contains a pre-final year college project focused on implementing face detection using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. Please note that the code may be unpolished, and we apologize for any messiness.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a web application capable of detecting human faces in images and real-time video streams. The system leverages OpenCV's pre-trained deep learning models to perform accurate face detection.

Features
Face Detection: Identifies and locates human faces within images and live video feeds.
Web Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images or access the webcam for face detection.
Real-time Processing: Processes live video streams to detect faces in real-time.
Technologies Used
JavaScript: Implements server-side functionality using Node.js.
HTML: Structures the web interface.
CSS: Styles the web interface, with configurations in tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
OpenCV: Performs image processing and face detection.
Express.js: Handles server-side operations.
Tailwind CSS: Provides utility-first CSS for styling.
Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/DivyanshuChaudharyOff/FaceDetection.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd FaceDetection
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use the face detection interface.

Usage
Image Upload: Upload an image to detect faces within the picture.
Webcam Access: Allow the application to access your webcam for real-time face detection.
