# Face Detection Project

This repository contains a pre-final year college project focused on implementing face detection using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. **Please note that the code may be unpolished, and we apologize for any messiness.**

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a web application capable of detecting human faces in images and real-time video streams. The system leverages OpenCV's pre-trained deep learning models to perform accurate face detection.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identifies and locates human faces within images and live video feeds.
- **Web Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to upload images or access the webcam for face detection.
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes live video streams to detect faces in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Implements server-side functionality using Node.js.
- **HTML**: Structures the web interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the web interface, with configurations in `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- **OpenCV**: Performs image processing and face detection.
- **Express.js**: Handles server-side operations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first CSS for styling.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DivyanshuChaudharyOff/FaceDetection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd FaceDetection
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to use the face detection interface.

## Usage

- **Image Detection**: Stay in frame for 5 secs 
- **Webcam Access**: Allow the application to access your webcam for real-time face detection.

## Acknowledgements

I extend our gratitude to the open-source community for providing the tools and libraries that made this project possible.
